# Internet-Download-Manager-Deletion-of-Keys

##Step1: Delete IDM Folders Manually
Copy and paste the **entire block below** into **Command Prompt (Admin)**:
rd /s "%appdata%\IDM"
rd /s "%localappdata%\IDM"
rd /s "%programfiles%\Internet Download Manager"
rd /s "%programfiles(x86)%\Internet Download Manager"

These commands remove: 

AppData settings
Local configuration
Program files
‚úÖ If you see "File Not Found" or "The system cannot find the file specified", it means the folders are already gone ‚Äî which is good! 


##Step2: Delete IDM Registry Keys
reg delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Internet Download Manager" /f
reg delete "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Internet Download Manager" /f
reg delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Internet Download Manager" /f

The /f means force delete
‚úÖ If you see "ERROR: The system was unable to find...", it means the key was already deleted ‚Äî still good! 

##Step3: Remove IDM from "Add or Remove Programs" List
reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall" /s | findstr /i "internet download manager"

If any GUID appears (e.g., {XXXX-XXXX-XXXX}), delete it:
reg delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{YOUR-GUID}" /f

üîç Most of the time, nothing shows up ‚Äî meaning it‚Äôs already clean. 

##Step4: Check for Hidden Leftovers (VirtualStore, Temp, etc.)
C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\

Enable hidden items in View tab to see AppData.

Ensure all things by doing step1. 
We all are set!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
